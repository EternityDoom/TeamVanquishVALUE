A `lightning-layout-item` defines content to display within `lightning-layout`. You
can arrange one or more `lightning-layout-item` components inside `lightning-layout`.

The `lightning-layout-item` components must be adjacent, with no other components or expressions between them.

Use the attributes
of `lightning-layout-item` to configure the size of the layout item,
and change how the layout is configured on different device sizes.

The layout system is mobile-first. Typically, the `small-device-size` attribute indicates a smart phone,
`medium-device-size` indicates a tablet, and `large-device-size` indicates a desktop or larger device.

If you specify the `small-device-size`, `medium-device-size`, or `large-device-size` attributes, you must also
specify the `size` attribute.

If you specify the `size` and `small-device-size`
attributes, the `size` attribute applies to small mobile
phones, and the `small-device-size` applies to smart phones. The device sizing
attributes are additive and apply to devices of the specified size and larger. For
example, if you set `medium-device-size=10` and don't set `large-device-size`, then
the `medium-device-size` setting applies to tablets, desktops, and larger
devices. You'd also have to set `size` to apply to devices smaller than tablets.

For general information on sizing, see [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/utilities/sizing/#overview).

Use the `flexibility` attribute to specify how the layout item adapts to the size of its container.
With default attribute values of size and flexibility, layout items take the size of their content and don't
occupy the entire width of the container.

Here is an example using default values.

```html
<template>
    <div>
        <lightning-layout>
            <lightning-layout-item padding="around-small">
                <div>1</div>
            </lightning-layout-item>
            <lightning-layout-item padding="around-small">
                <div>2</div>
            </lightning-layout-item>
            <lightning-layout-item padding="around-small">
                <div>3</div>
            </lightning-layout-item>
            <lightning-layout-item padding="around-small">
                <div>4</div>
            </lightning-layout-item>
        </lightning-layout>
    </div>
</template>
```

#### Usage Considerations

This component has usage differences from its Aura counterpart. See [Base Components: Aura Vs Lightning Web Components](docs/component-library/documentation/lwc/lwc.migrate_map_aura_lwc_components) in the Lightning Web Components Developer Guide.

#### Source Code

`lightning-layout-item` is available in the [Base Components Recipes GitHub repository](https://github.com/salesforce/base-components-recipes#documentation). It's transpiled into the `c` namespace so that you can use it in your own projects.
