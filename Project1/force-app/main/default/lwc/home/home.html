                            <p>A simple getaway to look at things.</p>
                            <p>A place....for window shoppers.</p>

                            <p>Here at "The Store", we don't sell products to consumers. What we do is provide an environment where people can walk around freely during 
                                their off time or whenever.  It's like being in the Mall, but you don't have to worry about being badgered by someone trying to sell you
                                something.  Does it sound like a pointless place? Yes! But, are you reading this right now an owner of a web-store with no physical store
                                front?  Maybe you have a store, but you would like to get visibility in a more populated area without paying exorbitant rent?  The Store
                                isn't just a place to walk around aimlessly and window shopping guilt free, it's a billbord with space available for advertisement!
